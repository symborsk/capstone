Setup Wizard


This code is based off of code that I developed in an open source context
for this capstone project. We wanted to contribute to class application notes software
as well as open source, and so I built this project for that purpose.

To that end, you can see the open source code (by me) that I have based this on
here: https://github.com/scarletspider616/setup-wizard

And this code is used and modified as per the MIT license it is bundled with.

To run the GUI: python3 Wizard.py
